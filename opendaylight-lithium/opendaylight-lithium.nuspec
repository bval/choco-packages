    <summary>OpenDaylight Platform - Lithium Service Release 2</summary>
    <description>
**From** https://www.opendaylight.org :

"OpenDaylight is leading the transformation to Open SDN. By uniting the industry around a common SDN platform, the ODL community is helping to make interoperable, programmable networks a reality. This is why so many regard OpenDaylight as the industry's de facto standard."

**From** https://www.opendaylight.org/lithium :

"Lithium is the third release of OpenDaylight, the open source platform for building programmable, software-defined networks. With Lithium, service providers and enterprises can transition to SDN with particular focus on broadening the programmability of intelligent networks. They can compose their own service architectures or leverage an OpenDaylight-based commercial offering to deliver dynamic network services in a cloud environment, craft dynamic intent-based policies and begin virtualizing functions with Service Function Chaining (SFC)."

**Chocolatey OpenDaylight Lithium** is not affiliated with the OpenDaylight project and does not include a copy of OpenDaylight. It just automatically downloads and installs OpenDaylight Lithium-SR2 and adds some extra tools for better integration into CMD shell (and PowerShell in future releases).
